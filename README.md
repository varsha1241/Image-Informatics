# Image-Informatics
This project focuses on  creating custom algorithm for image reading, followed by Haar wavelet transformation. The workflow includes wavelet denoising with VisuShrink thresholding, mean, median, and NL-means filtering, and weighted average fusion, achieving improved image clarity and effective noise handling.
